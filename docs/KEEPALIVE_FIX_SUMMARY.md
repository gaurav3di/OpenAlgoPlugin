# WebSocket Keepalive Ping Timeout Fix - Quick Summary

## üéØ Status: ‚úÖ FIX APPLIED - READY FOR TESTING

## Problem
WebSocket server was disconnecting every 30-60 seconds with:
```
CLOSE_FRAME (Status Code: 1011, Reason: keepalive ping timeout)
```

## Root Cause
- **Server sends:** PING with 4-byte payload every 20 seconds
- **Server expects:** PONG with **exact same 4-byte payload** (RFC 6455 requirement)
- **Plugin was sending:** PONG with **empty payload** (length 0)
- **Result:** Server rejected PONG ‚Üí closed connection with code 1011

## The Fix
Two code changes in `Plugin.cpp`:

### 1. Extract PING Payload (Line ~2163)
Modified `DecodeWebSocketFrame()` to extract PING payload and return as "PING_FRAME:XXXXXXXX" (hex format)

### 2. Echo Payload in PONG (Line ~2770)
Modified PING handler in `ProcessWebSocketData()` to:
- Parse hex payload from "PING_FRAME:XXXXXXXX"
- Echo it back in PONG frame
- Send properly formatted PONG with masked payload

## How to Build & Test

### Build
```cmd
cd C:\Users\Admin1\source\repos\OpenAlgoPlugin
build_release.bat
```

Or manually in Visual Studio (Release x64)

### Install
1. Close AmiBroker
2. Copy `Release\OpenAlgo.dll` to AmiBroker `Plugins\` folder
3. Restart AmiBroker

### Verify with DebugView
‚úÖ **SUCCESS - Look for:**
```
OpenAlgo: Received PING with 4-byte payload, sent PONG with echoed payload
```

‚ùå **FAILURE - Should NOT see:**
```
CLOSE_FRAME (Status Code: 1011, Reason: keepalive ping timeout)
```

## Expected Result
- ‚úÖ Connection stays alive indefinitely (no more 30-60 second disconnects)
- ‚úÖ Continuous tick flow without gaps
- ‚úÖ Real-time candles build correctly
- ‚úÖ Charts update smoothly

## Files Changed
```
Plugin.cpp:
  - Line ~2163: DecodeWebSocketFrame() - Extract PING payload
  - Line ~2770: ProcessWebSocketData() - Echo payload in PONG
```

**Fix Date:** October 24, 2025
**Issue:** Keepalive ping timeout (RFC 6455 compliance)
**Solution:** PONG echoes PING payload exactly
